      <h3>About the Series</h3>
      <p>
        Season 3 of Stranger Things—the Netflix show brought to you by the
        Duffer Brothers—released on July 4th. We won't spoil exactly what
        dangers the kids (and frankly, the entirety of Hawkins, Indiana) faced
        this year, although suffice to say that a mind flayer (of sorts) rears
        its head. And of course, you can also expect a fair amount of Dungeons &
        Dragons play... or at least attempted, with everything else going on!
        <br />
        If you've followed the show, you know how D&D plays a major role in the
        lives of these characters. If you played the game yourself back in the
        1980's, or interested to see what's underway with the game today, read
        on!
      </p>
      <h3>Play the game</h3>
      <p>
        The Stranger Things Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set contains everything
